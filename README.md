# Projects
## Automated Vision Inspection
The project aims to enhance and automate the quality control process in manufacturing and production industries.
Employing cameras and sophisticated image processing algorithms, the system captures detailed images and video footage of wood products, 
analyzing them in real-time for various quality aspects such as texture, color, grain, knots, and defects. By utilizing machine learning techniques, 
the project trains models capable of accurately identifying and categorizing acceptable and defective wood products.

## Updated BFS algorithm
This is a small priject contains BFS algorithm with some modification in searching way.
