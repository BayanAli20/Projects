# Projects
### 1. Automated Vision Inspection
The project aims to enhance and automate the quality control process in manufacturing and production industries.
Employing cameras and sophisticated image processing algorithms, the system captures detailed images and video footage of wood products, 
analyzing them in real-time for various quality aspects such as texture, color, grain, knots, and defects. By utilizing machine learning techniques, 
the project trains models capable of accurately identifying and categorizing acceptable and defective wood products.
-Tools and languages: Visual studio, Matlab, C#.

### 2. Updated BFS algorithm
This is a small priject contains BFS algorithm with some modification in searching way.
-This project written using C#.

### 3. If Else Compiler
This project contains a first step for how we can build a compiler to check one example if/else instruction. ()

### 4. DFA Algorithm
You can find the code for DFA algorithm.
-Tools and languages: Visual studio, C#.

### 5. Automated Flight Office
We designed ERD diagram to automate the whole process of reserving a flight trip.
-Tools and languages: Visual studio, C#.

### 6. Learning Interpretable Models from The Medical Records
In this project, we have considered different approaches to detecting earlier one of the most common eye diseases: glaucoma.
The black box model (Neural Networks) can accomplish the goal with high efficiency, but in this type of model, 
we are unable to comprehend how and why the results were computed. It may be possible for us (specialists) to understand it in some capacity, but it will be challenging to convince non-specialists or doctors to use it in their job.
Interpretability of the glaucoma model is essential, as it is in many healthcare-related projects. Therefore, we have decided to consider interpretable white models to achieve results that are clear and easy to understand by ophthalmologists.
-Tools and languages: Python, Colab, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Matplotlib, Sklearn.

### 7. Optimal Production Planning for Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
By employing the bee algorithm, the project seeks to minimize production time, reduce resource wastage, and optimize the utilization of machinery and manpower.
The algorithm explores different possibilities and evaluates their fitness based on predefined objectives, such as maximizing throughput, minimizing production costs, or reducing energy consumption.
-Tools and languages: Visual studio, C#.
